## A React SPA to display the stock holdings of Ark Invest.

* Each of Ark's 6 ETFs has its own component in the app. The most exciting feature is the component under "ALL" where every stock owned throughout all the ETFs are counted. This allows the user to get a better view of what Ark owns throughout the entire fund. I pull Arks Invests data from my Ark Api (https://github.com/adssoccer1/arkapiv3) and I also pull stock information from several other APIs. 

* After receiving feedback from users, I am working on another iteration of the app.
